# Racing Game (Traffic Racer)

“Traffic Racer” is a 2D car game made using OpenGL. In this game, the objective is to dodge 
the traffic, both oncoming and ongoing. 
The road is divided into two halves. The traffic on the left half moves in the direction of the 
player car, and the traffic on the right half moves in the opposite direction. 
The player controls the car using arrow keys (left and right). The player also needs to care 
about fuel which gradually decreases. 
For every car passed, score increases by 10. The player can get 2x score by moving to the 
wrong side and face oncoming traffic. The game also gives 3 lives to the player in case he 
collides with the traffic.
